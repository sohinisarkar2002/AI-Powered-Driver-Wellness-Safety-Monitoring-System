# AI-Powered Driver Wellness and Safety Monitoring System

## Academic Context & Collaboration Notice

This repository contains a group project developed as part of the BSc in Programming and Data Science degree course at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras. It is mirrored here for portfolio and demonstration purposes.

## Overview

This project is an academic prototype for a video-based **Driver Wellness and Safety Monitoring System**. The system is designed to monitor driver fatigue, distraction, seat belt usage, phone usage, smoking, drinking, head movement, gaze behavior, and other unsafe driving indicators.

The project started with drowsiness detection, but after Milestone 1 feedback, the scope was expanded into a broader driver monitoring system. Instead of relying only on frame-by-frame detection or hardcoded rules, the updated approach focuses on dataset preparation, temporal modeling, object detection, landmark-based feature extraction, and multi-module driver wellness analysis.

## Project Goal

The goal is to build a system that can analyze driver behavior using computer vision and deep learning, and classify the driver state into:

- **Safe**
- **Caution**
- **High Risk**

The final system is expected to combine outputs from multiple modules into a driver wellness score and generate alerts or reports based on detected risk events.
